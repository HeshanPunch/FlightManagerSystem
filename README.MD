# Project - Flight Management, CPRG251 Assignment 2
### Authors - Paolo Araujo, Heshan Punchihewa, Gukhee (Lauren) Sung

* Skeleton for the main GUI components was provided. We implemented action listeners, missing functions.

* This is a flight reservation management system with a functional GUI using Java Swing. This is intended to read from a (CSV) file of airports and flights, sort the data, use OOP principles(creat flight objects), and #write to a binary file to track the reservations.

* JAR file and JAVADOC included. To run the program fork and execute JAR file.

### Assignment expectations:
* Runnable JAR file 
* Javadoc documentation 
* Clear instructions 
* User interface design and functionality 
* Populates airports and flights  
* Find flights 
* Generate a reservation code 
* Make a reservation 
* Find reservations 
* Store reservations in a random-access file 
* Modify and cancel a reservation 
* Populate lists and allows selection 
* Handle Invalid flight code exception, invalid citizenship exception, Handle no more seats exception 
* Applicable fields not editable 

* There are some try/catch error handling deficiencies compensated with 'Throwable'

### Limitations
We struggled to solve some of the errors/exceptions because of how much time it took to solve the GUI/Swing challenges. We learned a lot and the challenge took us over 2 weeks working on the assignment alongside other assignments in the semester.
